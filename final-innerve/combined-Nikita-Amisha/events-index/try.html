    <p> Amanda is a Brazilian fashion designer <br>
        based in Miami. From an early <br> age she was interested in the arts and <br>
        manual tasks and her favorite activity was <br> always drawing, which she loves to do until <br>the present days.
         For Amanda, few things <br>are more pleasurable than seeing an idea <br>become material and enter people's lives,
          <br> creating bonds between those who create and<br> those who wear it. </p>

 <p> It's her way of being in the world. <br> She is fascinated by the beauty of colors and its <br> combinations, the mixture of geometric and organic shapes, <br> different materials with its textures and finishes. <br>
       She has always been curious and loves <br> to see and explore the world, learn other languages and cultures.  <br>Traveling is one of the things she enjoys the most, not only to relax,  <br>but also to learn and research. When younger,  <br>she moved to Germany to study design at Hochschule für <br> Gestaltung Offenbach am Main and then to Portugal to <br> specialize in Fashion Design at Universidade do Minho, <br> an opportunity that helped her to improve her knowledge on  <br>developing a fashion collection and creating a  <br>new product.
      Back to Brazil,  <br>she founded Trocando em Miúdos, a brand that has become a reference in  <br>accessories design and creative economy in Brazil. The brand gathered fans for  more than a decade and<br> its works were featured in several  <br>international medias and magazines such as <br> Vogue Brasil, Marie Claire, among others.
      <br> Since 2018 Amanda has been living in Miami, USA, a new experience that <br>  is helping her to expand her cultural horizons. Her values for a design  <br> process are shaped by building products with beauty, quality, meaning and purpose.</p>
